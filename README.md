# Steps to run this app:

- cd Search-places
- npm install (use 'npm i -f' if this doesn't work )
- npm run dev


# Notes

- I have also included the env file in the repository for testing of my app.
- Flag API was not working so I used some different API to integrate Flag.
- You need to press ENTER to search in the Search bar, I did this to reduce the number of API calls on each key press.
